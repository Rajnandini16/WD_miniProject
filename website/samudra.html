    <h1>The Churning of the Ocean (Samudra Manthan)</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Long, long ago, the gods, also known as Devas, and the demons, called Asuras, both wanted to become immortal. They heard that deep within the vast ocean was a special drink called Amrita, which could grant eternal life. However, getting this Amrita was a difficult task, one that neither the gods nor the demons could accomplish alone.</p>

    <p>So, they decided to work together, at least for this one big task. They used a massive mountain, Mount Mandara, as a churning stick. For the churning rope, they used Vasuki, the king of snakes. They wrapped the giant snake around the mountain and started to pull back and forth, churning the great ocean.</p>

    <p>As they churned the ocean for a long time, many amazing and wondrous things began to emerge. First, a deadly poison called Halahala came out. This poison was so potent that it threatened to engulf and destroy all of creation. The gods and demons were terrified. In an act of great compassion, Lord Shiva came forward and drank the entire poison to save everyone. The poison stayed in his throat, making it turn blue, and hence he is also known as Neelakantha, the blue-throated one.</p>

    <p>After the poison, many other treasures emerged from the ocean. There was Lakshmi, the beautiful goddess of wealth and prosperity; Airavata, the white elephant of Indra, the king of gods; Uchchaihshravas, a divine white horse; the Parijata tree, which had fragrant, heavenly flowers; and many other celestial beings and objects. Finally, Dhanvantari, the divine physician, appeared holding a pot filled with the precious Amrita.</p>

    <p>As soon as the Amrita appeared, the truce between the gods and demons broke. Both sides wanted the nectar for themselves. A fierce fight erupted. However, Lord Vishnu, in his wise and strategic way, took the form of Mohini, a beautiful enchantress. Mohini cleverly distracted the demons and distributed the Amrita only to the gods.</p>

    <p>Thus, the gods obtained immortality, while the demons were left without it. This story of the Samudra Manthan, or the Churning of the Ocean, is a significant tale in Hindu mythology. It symbolizes the struggle between good and evil, the importance of cooperation (even with adversaries), the emergence of both positive and negative forces from a common source, and the ultimate triumph of good with divine intervention. It also highlights the selflessness of Lord Shiva and the wisdom of Lord Vishnu.</p>
