    <h1>The Story of Ganga's Descent</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The story of the Ganga's descent to Earth begins with King Sagara, a powerful ruler of the Ikshvaku dynasty. King Sagara performed a grand Ashvamedha Yagna, a horse sacrifice that was a symbol of imperial power. According to tradition, if the sacrificial horse roamed unchallenged and returned, the king's authority would be undisputed. However, the horse was mysteriously stolen by Lord Indra, the king of the gods, who feared Sagara's growing power.</p>

    <p>Sagara sent his sixty thousand sons to find the missing horse. After a long search, they found the horse near the hermitage of Sage Kapila, who was deep in meditation. Mistakenly believing the sage to be the thief, the princes disrespectfully disturbed his meditation. Angered by their arrogance, Sage Kapila opened his eyes, and the sixty thousand sons of Sagara were instantly reduced to ashes.</p>

    <p>King Sagara was heartbroken by the fate of his sons. Their souls were trapped, unable to attain liberation (moksha) because their final rites had not been performed. Years passed, and subsequent generations of the Ikshvaku dynasty tried to find a way to liberate the souls of Sagara's sons, but to no avail.</p>

    <p>Finally, King Bhagiratha, a descendant of Sagara, felt a deep responsibility to his ancestors. He undertook severe penance for many years, praying to Brahma, the creator, to find a way to bring the holy river Ganga down from the heavens to Earth. Brahma appeared before Bhagiratha and told him that while Ganga could purify his ancestors, her descent would be immensely powerful. The Earth would not be able to withstand the force of her flow and would be destroyed.</p>

    <p>Bhagiratha then performed even more rigorous penance, this time praying to Lord Shiva, the only one capable of withstanding Ganga's mighty force. Pleased with Bhagiratha's devotion, Shiva agreed to receive Ganga onto his head.</p>

    <p>Goddess Ganga, who resided in the celestial realm, was initially reluctant to descend to Earth. However, moved by Bhagiratha's determination and Shiva's agreement, she agreed to make her descent. With tremendous force, Ganga plunged from the heavens and landed directly onto Lord Shiva's matted hair. Shiva, with his divine composure, calmly contained the river's immense power within his tangled locks.</p>

    <p>Bhagiratha then prayed to Shiva to release the Ganga. Slowly and gently, Shiva allowed the sacred river to flow down from his hair in several streams. These streams followed Bhagiratha as he led the way, eventually merging to form the mighty river Ganga on Earth. Because it was Bhagiratha's relentless efforts and devotion that brought the Ganga down, she is also known as Bhagirathi, especially in her upper reaches.</p>

    <p>The Ganga flowed across the land, and as she touched the ashes of King Sagara's sons, their souls were finally purified and attained liberation. The river Ganga became a sacred river for all, revered for her purifying powers and her life-giving waters, a testament to a king's unwavering devotion and a god's compassionate intervention.</p>
