    <h1>The Case of the Missing Mangoes</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Emperor Krishnadevaraya was particularly fond of the sweet and succulent mangoes that grew in the royal orchards near present-day Pune. During the peak mango season, a significant number of the choicest fruits mysteriously began to disappear from the heavily guarded groves. The royal guards were baffled; there were no signs of forced entry, and yet, baskets full of ripe mangoes vanished overnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emperor was understandably annoyed by this brazen theft within his own property. He ordered a thorough investigation, but the culprit remained elusive. Frustrated, Krishnadevaraya turned to Tenali Rama, hoping his unique approach could shed some light on the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenali Rama listened to the emperor's predicament with a thoughtful expression. He then announced his plan. "Your Majesty," he said, "I believe I know how to identify the mango thief. Please gather all the individuals who work in the royal orchards and have access to the mangoes. Ask them to assemble in the main courtyard tomorrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, a large group of gardeners, fruit pickers, and supervisors gathered in the courtyard, looking apprehensive. Tenali Rama arrived with a collection of freshly cut mango twigs, one for each person present. He distributed the twigs, saying, "These are special mango twigs from the sacred trees of our kingdom. Each of you must keep your twig with you overnight. By tomorrow morning, the twig belonging to the thief will have miraculously grown two inches longer. This divine test will reveal the guilty party."
    </p>
    <p>
      The workers, some nervous and some skeptical, took their twigs and dispersed for the night. Unknown to them, Tenali Rama had a clever trick up his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, everyone reassembled in the courtyard, holding their mango twigs. Tenali Rama began to inspect them carefully. Most of the twigs were the same length as before. However, one gardener's twig was noticeably shorter by two inches. Tenali Rama pointed to this gardener and declared, "This is the thief!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener, pale and trembling, immediately confessed to stealing the mangoes. He explained that he had been sneaking into the orchards at night and taking the ripe fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emperor Krishnadevaraya and the other courtiers were curious about how Tenali Rama's "magic" twig had worked. Tenali Rama explained with a smile, "Your Majesty, there was no magic involved. I simply gave everyone an identical mango twig. The thief, knowing his guilt and believing that the twig would indeed grow if he were innocent, was afraid of being exposed. To prevent his twig from appearing longer, he cleverly cut off two inches from it during the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The logic was simple yet brilliant. The innocent workers had no reason to alter their twigs, but the guilty one's fear and attempt to conceal his crime betrayed him. Emperor Krishnadevaraya was highly amused and impressed by Tenali Rama's ingenious method of catching the thief without any direct evidence. The tale became another popular anecdote showcasing Tenali Rama's sharp wit and his ability to solve problems using his understanding of human psychology.
