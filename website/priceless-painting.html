      Emperor Krishnadevaraya was a great patron of the arts, and his court was often graced by talented painters, sculptors, and musicians. One day, a renowned painter arrived, claiming to have created a masterpiece â€“ a painting so lifelike and exquisite that it was beyond price. He presented his work to the emperor, who was indeed impressed by the vibrant colors and intricate details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter, however, was also quite arrogant. He boasted that his creation was so perfect that it captured the very essence of life and nature, and no one in the court, not even the emperor himself, could truly appreciate its worth. This boastful attitude irked some of the courtiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Krishnadevaraya, always curious to see how Tenali Rama would handle such situations, turned to his witty advisor. "Rama," he said with a twinkle in his eye, "this painter claims his work is priceless. What is your opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenali Rama carefully examined the painting, observing not just the artistry but also the painter's haughty demeanor. After a moment, he addressed the painter with a seemingly innocent question. "O great artist," he began, "your work is indeed remarkable. Tell me, in this scene you have depicted, how many mangoes are there on that tree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter looked puzzled. "Mangoes? What mangoes? There are no mangoes in this painting. It depicts a serene forest scene with deer drinking water from a stream."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenali Rama smiled gently. "Exactly," he replied. "The painting is missing something that should naturally be there. If it were truly a perfect depiction of nature, wouldn't there be fruits on the trees, birds in the sky, or perhaps even a stray insect? Your painting, while beautiful, is incomplete and thus, not truly priceless. Everything in this world has a value, and its worth is often determined by its completeness and its connection to the reality it seeks to portray."
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrogant painter was taken aback by Tenali Rama's simple yet profound observation. He had focused so much on the technical skill that he had overlooked the natural elements that would have made the scene truly come alive. The other courtiers, who had been annoyed by the painter's arrogance, chuckled in agreement with Tenali Rama. Emperor Krishnadevaraya, amused and impressed by Rama's wisdom, praised his ability to cut through pretense with his sharp intellect.
