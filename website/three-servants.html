    <h1>The Conundrum of the Three Devoted Servants</h1>
  </header>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Once again, as King Vikramaditya steadfastly carried Betaal through the silent cremation grounds, the ghostly being began to weave another intricate narrative:</p>
    <p>"O King," Betaal began, his voice carrying a hint of intellectual challenge, "in a powerful kingdom near the Godavari River, there reigned a king known for his just rule and his unwavering commitment to dharma. This king had three exceptional servants, each renowned for their unique and devoted service."</p>
    <p>"The first servant, let us call him Dharmaveer (Warrior of Duty), was the king's loyal commander-in-chief. He had served the king for many years, leading the royal armies to victory in numerous battles, always placing the kingdom's safety and the king's command above his own life and family. His loyalty was unquestionable, forged in the fires of countless conflicts."</p>
    <p>"The second servant, let us name him Sevanishtha (Devoted in Service), was the king's personal attendant. He was tireless in his duties, anticipating the king's every need, ensuring his comfort, and managing the royal household with utmost care and dedication. He was always present, always attentive, and his devotion to the king's personal well-being was absolute."</p>
    <p>"The third servant, let us call him Rajanithi (Master of Diplomacy), was the king's chief advisor and diplomat. He possessed exceptional wisdom and political acumen, skillfully navigating complex alliances, resolving conflicts through negotiation, and safeguarding the kingdom from external threats through his strategic counsel. His loyalty lay in ensuring the stability and prosperity of the realm under the king's rule."</p>
    <p>"One day, a grave crisis befell the kingdom. A neighboring enemy, fueled by envy and greed, launched a massive invasion. The situation was dire, and the kingdom faced imminent danger. Each of the three devoted servants immediately sprang into action."</p>
    <p>"Dharmaveer rallied the royal forces, preparing for a fierce battle to defend the kingdom's borders, ready to lay down his life for the king and the land."</p>
    <p>"Sevanishtha, despite the chaos and fear, remained by the king's side, ensuring his safety, providing him with comfort, and attending to his needs amidst the turmoil, bolstering the king's spirits."</p>
    <p>"Rajanithi, recognizing the overwhelming strength of the invading army, embarked on a perilous mission to seek alliances with other neighboring kingdoms, hoping to gather reinforcements and turn the tide of the war through strategic diplomacy."</p>
    <p>"Tragically, in the ensuing conflict, news arrived that all three devoted servants had perished while fulfilling their respective duties. Dharmaveer fell valiantly on the battlefield, leading his troops in a final, desperate stand. Sevanishtha was killed while shielding the king from a surprise attack. And Rajanithi died while successfully securing a crucial alliance, but succumbing to injuries sustained during his journey back."</p>
    <p>Betaal paused, his gaze piercing through the darkness towards King Vikram. "Now, O just King, considering their selfless actions and ultimate sacrifice for their king and kingdom, tell me, in your wise judgment, which of these three devoted servants displayed the greatest loyalty? And what is the reasoning behind your choice?"</p>
    <p>King Vikram, after considering the profound dedication of each servant, responded with thoughtful conviction, "O Betaal, while all three servants displayed extraordinary loyalty and made the ultimate sacrifice, I believe that Rajanithi, the Master of Diplomacy, demonstrated the greatest loyalty. While Dharmaveer and Sevanishtha gave their lives in direct service and protection of the king and kingdom, Rajanithi's actions had the potential to save not just the king but the entire kingdom and its people in the long run. His strategic thinking and successful mission in securing alliances addressed the root threat and offered the greatest chance of survival and future stability for all. His loyalty extended beyond the immediate moment to the enduring well-being of the realm."</p>
    <p>As King Vikram delivered his reasoned judgment, Betaal let out a sigh, a hint of reluctant admiration in his ghostly voice, and with his familiar swiftness, vanished back into the branches of the Shimshapa tree, leaving the thoughtful king to continue his determined journey through the night.</p>
