<p> Once again, King Vikram, undeterred by his previous experience, ventured into the cremation grounds and retrieved Betaal from the Shimshapa tree. As they journeyed through the night, Betaal began another tale: </p> <p> "O King," Betaal started, his voice laced with a hint of amusement, "in a certain kingdom lived a wealthy merchant who had two wives. Both wives were equally beautiful and bore him sons. What was peculiar was that both wives gave birth to sons who were identical in every way â€“ their appearance, their mannerisms, even their voices were indistinguishable. As the boys grew, even those who knew the family well struggled to tell them apart." </p> <p> "The merchant loved all his sons equally and ensured they received the best education and upbringing. However, as they reached adulthood, the question of inheritance arose. The merchant wished to divide his wealth fairly among his sons, but the fact that there were two sets of identical twins, born to different mothers, created a significant dilemma. How could he determine who were the elder sons and thus entitled to a larger share according to the custom?" </p> <p> "The merchant consulted learned scholars, wise ministers, and even sought the advice of wandering ascetics, but no one could offer a definitive solution. There were no birthmarks, no distinguishing features, and even the mothers themselves sometimes confused their own sons with the others." </p> <p> "Finally, a renowned sage visited the kingdom. The merchant presented him with his predicament, hoping for a divine insight. The sage listened patiently and then devised a test. He gathered all four young men and placed before them four identical pots filled with milk. He then instructed each of them to carry their pot of milk and walk in a single file along a designated path. The sage observed them intently as they walked." </p> <p> "After they had walked a short distance, the sage declared his judgment. He pointed to two of the young men and proclaimed them to be the elder sons, entitled to the larger share of the inheritance. The merchant and everyone present were astonished. They could see no difference in how the young men had walked or carried their pots." </p> <p> Betaal paused, his eyes gleaming in the darkness. "Now, O King Vikram, tell me, what subtle difference did the sage observe that allowed him to distinguish between the elder and the younger sons? If you know the answer but do not speak, your head shall shatter into a thousand pieces." </p> <p> Vikram pondered for a moment, recalling the sage's wisdom. He then replied, "O Betaal, the difference was likely in their inherent sense of responsibility and perhaps a slight difference in their awareness of their position. The elder sons, knowing they would inherit more, might have carried themselves with a touch more gravity, a subtle awareness of their future role. Perhaps their gait was just a fraction more steady, their attention slightly more focused on not spilling the milk, reflecting a subconscious sense of ownership and future responsibility." </p> <p> As Vikram spoke these words, Betaal let out a loud laugh and once again flew back to his abode in the Shimshapa tree, leaving the determined King Vikram to continue his relentless pursuit. </p>
